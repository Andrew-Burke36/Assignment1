NewJeans band website
My project is aimed to showcase the band NewJeans to advertise their merchandise such as their apparel or albums and to be able to check their tour dates available currently and purchase the tickets for them. As well as to be able to check their socials on a variety of social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram or Facebook to name a few. So that incoming users can see the most important things of NewJeans of their band.

Design Process
Currently the design process is really aimed to current NewJeans fans or curious people who want to visit and explore who NewJeans are, so my website covers the band, tours and their merchandise so users can check tour dates if they are interested in watching them live or buying their merchandise to support them.

For instance in this case, a long-term fan wants to buy tickets and check current dates but external party websites dont have the most up to date information, so visiting the website and accessing the tour page will provide them present date information of the tours and links them to a trusted website to buy their tickets from.

Else in this instance is a user who wants to buy their merchandise to support them, currently the main page and the shop page both have merchandise, apparel and albums for them to purchase. As some websites may not be authentic products from NewJeans themselves. So users like them can be ensured the products on the page are actual authentic products with a variety to choose from.

Likewise, the website is catering to really push out merchandise to incoming users to increase profits for the group and the company, hence more of an emphasize of apparels on the main page to attract users as well as showing the tour for the group to attract users to buy the tour tickets to increase viewership for the group, profits and popularity and less of an emphasis on group publicization but ensuring that necessary information the users want to know is publicly available on the website for them to access.

Features

My current features on my website are account page that allows users to check on their orders, save their payments and update their profiles to be able to sign up to newsletters and etc, allowing users to have easier payment navigation when buying products, checking on purchased item. Through a sign up page and hence a log in page so that users can create their accounts to store their data and history when on the website.

Menu navigation overlay feature to have seamless navigation on both desktop view and mobile view and a menu cart navigation overlay on the right hand side of the website so users can check on their carts.

Responsive design for all platforms from desktop, tablet or mobile with appropriate font sizes and appropriate lay out designs especially for mobile to ensure easy navigation that is not too small or big.

Micro interactions when hovering over buttons or icons with some animations to indicate that you are hovering over that element.

Accessible design to link to different pages such as the shop, dashboard page or tour page on most of the pages rather than just a navigation overlay.

Features left to implement:
1.Filter buttons for the tour page and shop page to filter out certain products users want or check a certain continent for tour locations.
2.Option to buy items that move to the buy page and the buy cart.
3.Able to save card payment options

Technologies Used
Normalize.css was used in this project to ensure that all browser platforms have consistent styling across browsers, fixes common bugs, and preserves useful defaults, creating a reliable foundation for web development.

Testing
1.During testing some bugs that were noted to impact visual experience on mobile was that the footer and main page content had too much of a spacing inbetween and was not connected appropriately as compared to desktop.
2.My gradient background overlay when accessing the navigation sidebars such as the menu or cart bar did not work when the menu bars were open, this would not allow you to press on the outside of the menu bar to close the bar itself, hence the only way to exit out is to press the X button in the menu overlay to leave.

Overall, when visiting different platforms from desktop to mobile. Desktop will have large overlays and wide contents to fill the page, moving to tablets and mobile view, the viewing experience is in a smaller layout in grids such as the shop page where items will in lesser columns than on the desktop view. Tour page on mobile will be flipped into a column layout than a row layout for the tour information such as the date, country and ticket option.
